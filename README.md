# Neural-Network-Periodic-Function
Use back propagation and conjugate gradient method of predict periodic functions

<img src ="Neural-Network-Periodic-Function/pic.png" width="600">
The program is will train a 6-5-5-3-1 neutral nnetwork with 200 datas of a periodic function.
After training, the optimized model will predict the periodic feature of the function.
